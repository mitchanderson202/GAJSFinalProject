How to use: Pick 4 movies. This will create your own movie. Feel free to change decision mid way after making your decisions.. Otherwise, hit Try Again to wipe it and start fresh.

Stack:
- JavScript
- HTML
- CSS(Minimal)

As this course was specific to JavaScript, there isn't much CSS in this project.
